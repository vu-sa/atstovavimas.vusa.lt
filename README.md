This site is used for Representing guide project, by VU SA. **Work in progress!**

## Framework

- [x] Laravel - main framework.
- [x] Bootstrap - for style.

## Style elements

- [ ] Vertical left navbar
  - [ ] Accordion
  - [ ] To mobile
- [ ] Slight grey papery(?) background
- [ ] Headers and subheaders as links
  - [ ] With clickable links
  - [ ] With icons
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Look at Laravel docs and Bootstrap docs for more examples.

## Other elements

- [ ] Lazy loading for images
  - [ ] Add `noscript` for all images.
- [x] Many hyperlinks (internal and external)
  - [x] Don't forget external to `_blank`
- [x] Readable font and its size
- [ ] Sticky button to go to section start (???)
  - [ ] [Reference](https://css-tricks.com/creating-sliding-effects-using-sticky-positioning/)
- [ ] Use shadows (???)

## Tricks used

- Graphs post-export
  - Change Roboto-* to Roboto and add `font-weight` or `font-style` which is appropriate.
  - Wrap `<a>` tags around elements, with a bootstrap template for popover. Change any info necessary.
